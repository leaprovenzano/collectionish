Collectionish is a pure python library extending the basic collection data types and operations for working with them.

Getting Started:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the latest stable version with pip::

   $ pip install collectionish

**A quick note about python version support**:

``collectionish`` works with python 3 and has been fully tested with
python 3.7 and 3.8. There is no plan to support backwards compatability
for python 2 or 3.5.

**Checkout the docs**:

It's best to checkout the `docs`_. There you'll find detailed
documentation of ``collectionish``'s features and lots of examples of
how to use them.

What's is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is a wonderful language when it comes to extending inbuilt types
and making things that quack. ``collectionish`` subscribes to the
ideology that the behaviour of data structures belongs *in* data
structures and that it's better and more graceful to bake the behavior
into a type than to complicate surrounding business logic creating many
more wtf moments and room for bugs to sneak in.

Python's own `collections`_ module is a great example. take
``defaultdict``, how many times have you seen something like this?

.. code:: python


   pets = [('cat', 'tabby'),
           ('cat', 'ginger'),
           ('dog', 'beagle'),
           ('dog', 'poodle'),
           ('lizard', 'gecko')
          ]

   pet_dict = {}
   for typ, subtyp in pets:
       try:
           pet_dict[typ].append(subtyp)
       except KeyError:
           # now we'll need to make an comment to explain...
           # if the key doesn't exist pet_dict we make a new
           # list containing the pet's subtype
           pet_dict[typ] = [subtyp]


vs:

.. code:: python


   from collections import defaultdict

   pet_dict = defaultdict(list)
   for typ, subtyp in pets:
       pet_dict[typ].append(subtyp)

``collectionish`` adds some extra collections such like `AttyDict`_ (a
straightforward recursive dot access ``dict`` ) and `UniqueTuple`_ ( a
tuple of unique items that remembers insertion order). New collections
will be added fairly regularly on the basis that they are generic enough
and useful enough that i find myself repeating them in other projects.

In addition to data structures ``collectionish`` also provides some
operations for working with data structures (from both standard python
and ``collections``) like the recursive getters and setters
`collectionish.ops`_.

Principles:
~~~~~~~~~~~

**useful enough:**
    Inspirations for data structures should come from stuff we've written or needed before at some point.

**generic enough:**
    To be extended within reason.

**specific enough:**
    To be clear about what things do. We don't aim to make *the* data structure or stand in for a pandas
    dataframe that does everything.

**intuitive enough**:
    type hinting should generally work the same as it does with parent types, signatures should not be wildly
    different, obvious magic methods or such as ``__iter__`` should not generally be missing from data types.

**documented enough:**
    All public structures and ops should be documented and have doctest examples so we know its correct and
    It should be fairly obvious from somethings name what it is.

**tested more than enough:**
    we test with the excellent `hypothesis`_ library wherever possible. We do doctests to keep documentation correct.
